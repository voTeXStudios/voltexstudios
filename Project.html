            <p class="content1">The Project is a Game. It's called the Aperture. It's an FPS game with Co-op functionality. Game has been designed for 2 people specifically. 
                We chose to make a game because we are a group of 4 hardcore gamers, and wanted to dive into this field to know how it feels like developing a Game. <br><br> 
                The project design is inspired 
                from the the actual game from Aperture Laboratories, The Portal. Our game consists of two levels, they are in continuation. 
                If you fail to finish the whole game, you start from level 1 again.
                We decided this would be an interesting feature since the map is not that huge, and the game only has 2 levels, therefore, making it much more challenging. </p>

            <p class="content1">Two players will be spawned into a spawn room when the game is started. 
                One of the players will have a gun to shoot portals and the other one will be having a gun
                to shoot the Bots. The puzzle is quite simple. You have to get to a blue room, where the game finishes. The Portals are there to solve the puzzle. 
                Both the players can get through
                 the portals. <br><br>
                While solving the puzzle, the players will have obstacles, which are THE ENEMY BOTS. The concept is simple. 
                One player needs to protect his partner and himself from getting killed by the BOTS
                The other player can pick up objects, open up the doors to progress in the game. In Layman's terms, it's advisable for both the players to be together.
                 As released in the news, there are 3 types 
                of Enemy Bots, two standard and the Alpha. To assist you initially in the game, some ammos and shields are there to give you a lift.<br>
